This project is a very basic project in Java that is used to convert a currency from 
one to another. A web-based interface for converting currency and getting the output

the current exchange prices in the market and then can convert from one currency to 
another. A calculator-like application, developed using Ajax, Applet, and web features 
of Java servlets. You also get a regular update when there’s a change in the value of the
country’s currency and also the conversion rate.

People use this application basically for business, shares, and finance-related areas
where currency exchange and money transfer happen daily. You get a preferred choice to convert
any country’s currency. Just enter the amount, the currency to which you want to transform 
to, click enter and you get the output.
